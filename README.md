# My title was "Save the Princess!" for obvious reasons; it's a game about saving a princess.
# The purpose of my project was to learn more about python, and fulfil a very old dream of mine that was to create a game.
# My goal was to learn about python but also pygame, so that when I create another game I can make it better.
# For technology, I use pygame and many sprites that have been linked within my google document.
